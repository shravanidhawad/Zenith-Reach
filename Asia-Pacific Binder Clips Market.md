In residential settings, binder clips are increasingly being used for a variety of organizational tasks such as securing bills, storing papers, and even as an accessory for personal craft projects. The versatility of binder clips in home environments has contributed to their growing popularity. They are particularly valued for their ability to hold items together securely without causing damage, unlike other methods like staples or paper clips.

In office environments, binder clips are primarily used to manage documents, keeping them grouped together for easier access and storage. As companies grow and handle increasing amounts of paperwork, binder clips serve as a practical and inexpensive tool for keeping files organized.
